## API Overview

The UserPostAPI is a RESTful API that allows managing users and posts. The system supports:

* CRUD operations for both users and posts.
* Retry and recovery mechanisms while creating users.
* Custom exception handling for all major error scenarios.
* In-memory persistence for simplicity.
* Fully containerized and deployed using AWS App Runner and GitHub CI/CD.

---

## Project Architecture & Code Structure

The application is designed following clean layered architecture principles to ensure:

* Code separation
* Scalability
* Maintainability
* Testability

### Code Segregation

| Package                    | Responsibility                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `controller`               | Handles HTTP requests & exposes REST APIs                       |
| `service`                  | Business logic layer (orchestration logic happens here)         |
| `repository`               | Data access layer (In-memory data storage implementation)       |
| `model`                    | POJO classes representing domain entities (User, Post)          |
| `exception`                | Centralized exception handling and custom exception definitions |
| `UserPostApplication.java` | Application bootstrap class (Spring Boot entry point)           |

### Benefits of This Design

* Clear separation of concerns (Controller - Service - Repository).
* Easy to maintain and extend (Database addition requires minimal changes).
* Simplifies unit testing and mocking layers.
* Makes retry, recovery, and exception handling modular.
* Aligned with Spring Boot best practices.

### API Design Summary

* Follows REST principles (resource-based URLs, proper HTTP methods).
* All inputs are handled using `@Valid` and `@RequestBody` annotations.
* Exception handling is centralized through `RestExceptionHandler`.
* `ResponseEntity` is used to return appropriate status codes and responses.
* Clean separation of controller, service, and repository layers.

## How to Run Locally (from ZIP file)

### Unzip the Code

```bash
unzip your-file-name.zip
cd extracted-folder-name
```

### Install Java

Make sure Java 17 is installed.

```bash
java -version
```

### Install Maven

Check if Maven is installed:

```bash
mvn -version
```

If Maven is not installed, install it accordingly.

### Run Directly from Source Code (No JAR needed)

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run

## Application URL

* `https://qsmgq6qpcg.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/users`
* `https://qsmgq6qpcg.us-east-2.awsapprunner.com/posts`

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing

* The `UserServiceImplTest` class tests service layer business logic.
* Used Mockito framework to mock repository layer.
* Test scenarios included:

  * Fetching all users.
  * Fetching user by ID (valid and invalid).
  * Exception handling (`ResourceNotFoundException`).
* Assertions performed using JUnit and AssertJ.

### Integration Testing

* The `UserControllerTest` class tests the REST controller layer.
* Used `@WebMvcTest` for controller-only testing.
* Used MockMvc for HTTP request-response simulation.
* Test scenarios included:

  * Creating a user (`POST /users`).
  * Fetching a user (`GET /users/{id}`).
* ObjectMapper used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
* Service layer was mocked using Mockito.

### Tools & Libraries Used

* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* Spring Boot Test
* MockMvc
* ObjectMapper (Jackson)

---

## Deployment Process

### Local Development

* Spring Boot REST API developed & tested locally.

### Containerization (Dockerfile)

Hereâ€™s the Dockerfile used for containerization:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
VOLUME /tmp
COPY target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
```

### Version Control

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <github-repo-url>
git push origin main
```

### AWS App Runner Deployment

* Source Code Repository: GitHub
* Branch: `main`
* Runtime: Dockerfile
* Fully managed build & deployment by App Runner

### CI/CD Automation

* App Runner automatically redeploys on every commit pushed to GitHub.

### CI/CD Pipeline Details

CI/CD is implemented via AWS CodePipeline which has 4 steps:

1. **Source code pull stage** - Pulls the code automatically on changes from GitHub repo (main branch).
2. **Build using AWS CodeBuild** - Builds the Maven JAR package.
3. **Docker image using ECR** - Creates the Docker image in AWS ECR.
4. **Deployment of service using AWS App Runner** - Hosts the app remotely by deploying the generated ECR image.
